    "- An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same data type in a contiguous block of memory. It allows you to access individual elements directly by their numerical index, which is a position that starts at 0. Arrays are useful for storing and organizing multiple related values under a single name, such as a list of student scores. \n",

    "- Sorting is the process of arranging array elements in a specific order, such as ascending or \n",
    "descending. Here are some common sorting algorithms:  \n",
    "- Simple sorts (typically less efficient for large datasets)  \n",
    "    - 1. Bubble Sort: Compares and swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order, \n",
    "    repeating the process until the array is sorted. \n",
    "    - 2. Selection Sort: Finds the minimum or maximum element in the unsorted portion of \n",
    "    the array and places it at the beginning of the sorted portion. It repeats this until the \n",
    "    entire array is sorted. \n",
    "    - 3. Insertion Sort: Builds the sorted array one element at a time. It iterates through the \n",
    "    array, taking one element and inserting it into its correct position within the already \n",
    "    sorted part.  \n",
    "- Efficient sorts (better performance on large datasets) \n",
    "    - 4. Merge Sort: A \"divide-and-conquer\" algorithm that divides the array, sorts the halves \n",
    "    recursively, and then merges them. \n",
    "    - 5. Quick Sort: Selects a pivot and partitions the array into two sub-arrays to be sorted \n",
    "    recursively. \n",
    "    - 6. Heap Sort: Uses a binary heap to sort an array by repeatedly extracting the \n",
    "    maximum (or minimum) element. \n",
    "    - 7. Counting Sort: Counts element frequencies to place them in sorted positions, \n",
    "    efficient for a limited range of numbers. \n",
    "    - 8. Radix Sort: Sorts elements by grouping them into buckets based on their digits, \n",
    "    starting with the least significant digit.  \n",
    "#### Searching algorithms :\n",
    "- Searching involves finding an element's location in an array. Its efficiency often depends on \n",
    "whether the array is sorted.  \n",
    "- Unsorted array searches \n",
    "    - 1. Linear Search: Checks each element sequentially until the target is found. It works on \n",
    "    any array but is inefficient for large ones.  \n",
    "- Sorted array searches (highly efficient) \n",
    "    - 2. Binary Search: Works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search interval in \n",
    "    half. \n",
    "    - 3. Jump Search: Skips elements in fixed steps then performs a linear search. It's better \n",
    "    than linear search but slower than binary search. \n",
    "    - Interpolation Search: Estimates the target's position based on its value relative to \n",
    "    other elements in a uniformly distributed sorted array. \n",
    "    - 4. Exponential Search: Useful for unbounded sorted arrays, it finds a range for the \n",
    "    target and then uses binary search. \n",
    "    - 5. Fibonacci Search: Similar to binary search but uses Fibonacci numbers to divide the \n",
