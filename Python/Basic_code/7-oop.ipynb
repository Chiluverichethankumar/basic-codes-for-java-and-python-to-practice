    "#### Step-by-step explanation (what each piece demonstrates)\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1. Public member (self.name)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Accessible everywhere: inside class, in subclass, and from outside.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Use it freely for data that has no special constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2. Protected member (self._breed)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - By convention, single underscore means: \"internal use or subclass use; don't touch it from outside unless you know what you're doing.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Python does not enforce protection — you can read/write _breed externally. The example shows a._breed = `\"ChangedBreed\" is allowed but discouraged.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 3. Private member (self.__age, self.__secret)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Python performs name mangling: __age on class Animal becomes attribute _Animal__age on the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Direct access like a.__age raises AttributeError. (You saw this in Direct private access error: ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Inside a subclass, self.__age looks for _Dog__age (not _Animal__age) because name mangling uses the current class name — so the subclass cannot directly access the base class private var.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - You can still (if you really want) access via a._Animal__age or call a._Animal__private_info() — but that’s a hack and defeats encapsulation. Don’t do it in production code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 4. Getter/Setter (traditional)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - get_age() and set_age() let you control how the private value is read or written.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - set_age() enforces age must be a positive integer; if invalid, it raises ValueError. That prevents illegal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 5. Property decorators (@property, @age.setter)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Pythonic and convenient: you use a.age and a.age = 6 but behind the scenes the getter/setter methods run.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This gives the clean syntax of direct attribute access with the safety of checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 6. Subclass behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Subclass can access:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Public: self.name\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Protected: self._breed (okay by convention)\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Private: not by self.__age (raises AttributeError), but can via name-mangling self._Animal__age (disallowed practice).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Assigning to self.__age inside Dog creates _Dog__age — a separate attribute — which can cause bugs if you expected it to overwrite the base class private field.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 7. Why name-mangling can trick you\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Name-mangling prevents accidental overrides, but it can confuse you: assigning self.__age in a subclass will not change the base class’s __age. Always use protected attributes (_age) or public accessors if subclass should change them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Errors you will see (and why)\n",
    "\n",
    "- AttributeError: 'Animal' object has no attribute '__age' — raised when trying a.__age. The attribute exists under the mangled name _Animal__age, so a.__age is not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ValueError: Age must be a positive integer — raised by the setter when invalid input is provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you mistakenly set self.__age in a subclass, you create a different attribute (_Dog__age) — this does not raise an error but leads to logical bugs (two ages).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Best practices / rules to follow\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Prefer single underscore (_var) for attributes intended for internal/subclass use. It’s simple and clear.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. Use double underscore (__var) only when you truly need to avoid name clashes in subclasses (rare).\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. Provide @property and .setter when you want controlled, pythonic access with validation.\n",
    "\n",
    " 4. Don’t access private attributes with name-mangling (e.g., obj._ClassName__attr) — that defeats encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    " 5. Avoid exposing internal state unnecessarily; expose behavior (methods) instead of raw data.\n",
    "\n",
    " 6. For subclasses that must modify parent data, either:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Use protected fields (_var) and document the subclass contract, or\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Provide public/protected setter methods in the base class."
